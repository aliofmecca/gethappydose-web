      "You're not new to this. You've been buying supplements for years — every one of them promised something. Some of them probably even worked, for a minute. But nobody ever sat you down and explained how this actually works. So you did what every smart person does when nobody is teaching them: you guessed. And you've been quietly paying for that guess ever since.",

      "Or did you just assume that because it's in your system, *it's in your system*? Those are not the same sentence. A pill can travel through you completely undigested — blocked by the wrong food, sabotaged by the wrong timing, or canceled out by the wrong neighbor in the same dose. This isn't opinion. It's basic _pharmacokinetics_. It's in every first-year nutrition textbook, every clinical absorption study, and every honest conversation between a pharmacist and a patient who finally asks the right question. The supplement industry has spent twenty years making sure you never ask it. HappyDose is built around it.",

Pills can pass through you completely undigested, blocked by the wrong food, the wrong timing, or the wrong neighbor in the same dose. You wouldn't buy a gym membership and never go.

This is the layer every other supplement app will try to add in two years — you get it on day one. It never lies to make you feel good. If something isn't working, it will say so out loud.",
